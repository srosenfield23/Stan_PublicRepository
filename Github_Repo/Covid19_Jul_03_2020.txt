* New cases rate defined as: the percentage ratio
   between today's new cases over total cases,
   minus yesterday's new cases over total cases.


* Rates of infection defined as: the percentage ratio
   between today's new cases over 10,000 per capita


*** Death Rate defined as: the percentage ratio 
      between today's new deaths over total deaths,
      minus yesterday's new deaths over total deaths.


*** Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) analysts
      said in a note: Death ratios will depend
      on the capacity of countries to effectively
      detect, track, and contain the epidemic.
